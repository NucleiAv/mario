# Mario_Kart 🏎️✨

**Mario_Kart** is a simple, arcade-style endless runner inspired by the classic Mario universe.  
The player controls Mario and must **jump over incoming blocks** to survive and score points.  
The longer you survive, the higher your score!

## 🎮 Features
- **Endless Gameplay:**  
  The game keeps running infinitely, testing your reflexes and timing.
  
- **Jump Mechanic:**  
  Press `W` to make Mario jump. Gravity pulls him back down realistically.
  
- **Dynamic Difficulty:**  
  The falling and movement speed of Mario adapt slightly based on how fast you're moving (using lerping and constraints).

- **Block Spawning:**  
  Blocks (obstacles) spawn at random intervals, and you must time your jumps to avoid them.

- **Game Over Screen:**  
  Collision with a block ends the game, and your final score is displayed.

- **Minimal Pixel Art:**  
  Custom tiny pixel sprites for Mario, blocks, sky, and ground, adding a retro vibe.

## 📜 Fun Backstory
Although I originally made this game back in **2023**, it randomly clicked to me one day that I should properly set up a **GitHub repository** for it.  
Sometimes, good ideas just strike when you least expect them! 🚀
